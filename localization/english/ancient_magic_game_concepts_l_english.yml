 game_concept_mage_spell_desc:0 "When a [GetTrait('mage').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LV] says that they are casting a spell, what they mean is that they are drawing on years of training to put themselves into a certain state of mind. While not necessary, due to the complexity of even the most simple spells, most mages often uses specific spell mnemonics - words and gestures which help them to remember the state of mind a spell requires.\n\nOnce the mage has achieved the necessary state of mind, they "cast" this spell out into the world around them. The ability to "cast" is what distinguishes those with [GetTrait('magic_potential_1').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LV] from everyone else in the world.

Like aura spells, a ritual may typically only be cast on or near the [GetTrait('mage').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LVl] which casts them. Unlike auras, however, rituals do not require that a mage continually maintain them in order for the spell to be effective. They simply produce whatever effects they are designed to produce, then dissipate like any other spell.\n\nThough a ritual is sometimes used because the spell being cast requires more power than one mage may contain on their own, this is not the primary use of a ritual style spell. More often, they are used to cast spells which are, by their nature, prohibitively complex, such as those which are necessary for the creation of golems, the undead, or any other being with some semblence of a mind. It is simply not feasible to produce a construct of any complexity without using an equally complex spell construct to define the parameters of such creature's behavior."

 game_concept_pestilence_desc:0 "The pestilence spell, when cast in its weakest form, acts upon its subject's immune system, diminishing it in ways which leave the target vulnerable to all manner of illnesses which they would normally be able to fight off.\n\nWhen employed by an expert [necromancer|El], however, this spell becomes a horrific demonstration of the power of this [school_of_magic|E]. By keeping the victim's immune system weakened, and directly influencing the growth of their illness, the practioner is able to engineer a truly virulent and deadly plague. This plague is almost always lethal to any individual that is exposed to it, and is able to spread from one victim to another, killing droves.\n\n#P the spell target is afflicted with [GetTrait('bubonic_plague').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LV]#!\n\n@warning_icon! #N This disease may spread to others#!"
 game_concept_consume_life:0 "Consume Life"
 game_concept_consume_life_desc:0 "The infamous 'consume life' spell is among the most evil of spells known in any [school_of_magic|E]. It draws on the corrosive, destructive, and hungry nature of [necromancy|E], using that nature to drain the life-force of the spell's target and feed it back into its caster. If the caster exerts more will, they may even drain the target so quickly that the victim expires immediately, though this approach disperses the victim's life-force so rapdily that the caster is unable to consume it."

Among the simplest of all aura spells, the necromancer's 'aura of death' doesn't do anything particularly flashy. All a practioner needs to do in order to cast this spell is to place themselves in the state of mind required to cast a necromancy spell. This voluntary madness, and the energies associated with it, produce a pervasive sense of unease in anyone near the spell caster.\n\n#P +5#! [dread|E] modifier@dread_icon! / [mage_level|E]"
 game_concept_manipulate_blood:0 "Manipulate Blood"
 game_concept_manipulate_blood_desc:0 "The 'manipulate blood' spell is the quinessential [biomancy|E] spell. Attempting to match their thoughts to the nature of the target the practioner wishes to affect, the spell caster is able to create an equivalency between themselves and their target. If the target of the spell is the [biomancer|E] themself, this is easy, while the process is more difficult when attempting to manipulate the blood of others. In either case, the caster exploits this equivalency to alter the physiological nature of the target.\n\n At low levels of mastery, the caster is able to accentuate traits which are already present in the target to some degree, while more experienced practioners are able to bring those traits to the summit of human capability, or to even create them if they don't exist.\n\nIn addition, a biomancer with an expert level of understanding may produce more complex traits such as gigantism, dwarfism, or blindness in their target through a combination of blood manipulation and by magically sculpting the target's body."
 game_concept_conception:0 "Conception"
 game_concept_conception_desc:0 "The 'conception spell' is a spell which allows the [biomancer|El] to manipulate the natural reproduction of themselves and others, and one that many spell casters, especially those with an interest in dynastic affairs, cultivate. Practioners with limited experience in the [biomancy|E] [school_of_magic|E] are able to use this spell to either stop, or greatly increase their fertility, thereby controlling their chances of having children.\n\nA far more nefarious, and some would say, evil application of this spell is to use it as a means of forcing a victim to conceive a child with the [biomancer|El] through magic. This practice is frowned upon, but persists, due to the obvious advantages to scrupulous biomancers in a feudal society.\n\nUnfortunately, or fortunately, depending on who you ask, due to some esoteric principles only understood by the [biomancer|El] community, it is not possible to use this spell to alter the fertility of others, though this is not due to a lack of trying on their part."

 game_concept_manipulate_mind_desc:0 "The 'manipulate mind' spell is one of the most versatile spell constructs in any [school_of_magic|E], and is the signature spell for any aspiring [mensomancer|El]. By connecting themselves to their target, the caster of this spell is able to send information directly into the victim's mind.\n\nDue to the difficulty of this spell, less experienced [mensomancer|El]#E s#! are limited to affecting only the simplest areas of the brain, but as the practitioner gains experience, they gain the ability to affect their victims in a larger number of ways and, eventually, to take control of the target completely.\n\nThe spell's effects may manifest in any number of ways, but common themes include making someone believe that the caster is a friend, a rival, a lover, or a feared and respected authority figure. At higher levels, the spell caster may create powerful compulsions, forcing their targets to serve them, and even take direct control of their victim's body."
