As your spell builds, coming closer to the surface of reality, on the verge of manifesting, you can see something akin to admiration kindling in the eyes of your courtiers and subjects alike. Will you invest some [mana|El] to manifest the aura?"

 ancient_magic_spellbook_events.703.desc:0 "You weave a delicate spell construct out into an area roughly the size of a large room, pouring your will into it, and imprinting a single command within the minds of all in your presence. 'No lies'. Of course, they will never hear the command. You spell is more insidious than that. It promotes and magnifies the natural discomfort that most people feel whenever they tell a lie, but if people want to believe that it somehow forces them to tell the truth, why not let them believe it? Satisfied with your spell construct, you prepare to invest it with [mana|El]."
